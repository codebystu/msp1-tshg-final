# The Self Help Group
Testing was carried out throughout the development of the site, all visual components and layout design were viewed on a variety of screen sizes before during and after styling using Google Dev Tools in the Chrome browser, and following the completion of each page further testing was carried out on Firefox and Edge on my laptop and Safari on an iphone 11, iphone 6s and ipad air 2, both for a visual check of layout and to test all feature and link functionality.
Automated testing was carried out using a variety of web applications. All are documented below.
